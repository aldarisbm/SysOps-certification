## S3 Overview

- Globally Unique
- Regionally provisioned

- Key is fullpath
    - s3://mybucket/[my_file.txt] -> Key
    - s3://mybucket/[hello/world.txt] -> Key

- Key is composed by key prefix + object name
    - prefix /hello
    - object name world.txt

- There's no concept of directories within buckets
    - UI "tricks" you otherwise

- Object Values are the content of the body
    - Max is 5TB
    - Cannot more than 5GB at a time (multi-part upload)

- Metadata (list of text key/value pais - system or user metadata)
- Tags (unicode k/v up to 10)
- Version ID (if versioning is enabled)

- s3 bucket view shows buckets in all regions
- If you right click -> open an s3 object it uses presigned urls

### Versioning
- Has to be enabled at the bucket level
- Same key overwrite will increment the version -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (intricate string)
- It is best practice to version your buckets
    - Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
    - any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version `null`
- If you delete an object you get a:
    - delete marker
    - if you delete the `delete marker` it shows again
    - you can delete specific versions

### Encryption
- SSE-S3 - keys handled n managed by AWS
- SSE-KMS - KMS to manage encryption keys
- SSE-C - When you want to manage your own encryption keys
- Client Side Encryption

- SSE-S3
    - Keys handled n managed by AWS s3
    - Object is encrypted server side
    - must set header

- KMS
    - Keys handled n managed by KMS
    - user control + audit trail
    - Object is encrypted server side
    - must set header

- SSE-C
    - S3 does not store the encryption key you provide
    - HTTPS must be used!! (youre sending the key)
    - Encryption key must ve provided in HTTP headers, for every HTTP req made
    - AMazon does not keep the key

- Client Side Encryption
    - Clients library such as the Amazon S3 encrpytion client
    - Clients must encrypt n decrypt the data themselves before sending and after retrieving from s3
    - Client fully manages the key and encryption cycle

- Encryption in flight is also called SSL/TLS

- Default Encrpytion
    - AES-256
    - KMS
    - NONE

### S3 Security
- User based
    - IAM policies (which API calls they are allowe to make)
- Resource based
    - Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the s3 console - allows cross acct
- Object ACL
    - finer grain
- Bucket ACL
    - less common

- an IAM principal can access an s3 object if
    - the user IAM policies allow it OR the resource policy allows it
    - AND theres no explicit DENY

- S3 Bucket policy
    - JSON based
    - Resources:
        - Buckets
        - Object
    - Effect
        - Allow
        - Deny
    - Principal
        - Acct or user
    - grant public access to the bucket
    - grant access to another acct
    - force objects to be encrypted on upload

### Bucket settings for Block Public Access
- Block public acces to buckets n objects granted through
    - new acces control lists
    - any access control list
    - new public bucket or access point policies
- Block public and cross-acount access to bucket and objects through any public bucket or access point policies

- S3 Security - Other
    - Supports VPC endpoints (for instances in VPC without interwebs)
    - Loggin and Audit
        - S3 acces logs can be stored in other s3 buck
        - API calls can be logged in AWS cloudtrail
    - User Security
        - MFA DELETE
        - Pre-Signed URLs


### CORS
- Same origin www.example.com/hello && www.example.com/world
- Diff origin api.example.com/hello && www.example.com/world

### S3 Consistency Model
- Eventually consistent
- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
    - PUT 200 -> GET 200
    - GET 404 -> PUT 200 -> GET 404 (eventually consistent) 
- Eventual consistency
    - If you read an object right after updating it, you might get the older version 
        - PUT 200 -> PUT 200 -> GET 200 (might be older version)
        - DELETE 200 -> GET 200! (you might have a successful get - Eventual consistency)
- No way to get strong consistency
